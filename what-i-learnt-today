- There is a package called 'posix_cc' in openSUSE. Suckless programs
expect c99 and this package provides that compiler. Otherwise, we can
also do,

        CC='gcc -std=c99' make

- There is an equivalent (somewhat) of 'whatprovides' in zypper, that
goes as below.

        zypper se --provides "pkgconfig(webkit2gtk-4.0)"
