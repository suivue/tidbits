How to delete default storage pool in lxc:

The default storage cannot be deleted because it is part of the default
profile. The default profile cannot be removed. So the way around this is
to push a blank profile to the default profile with;

    printf 'config: {}\ndevices: {}' | lxc profile edit default

Then the default storage will be removed from the default profile, so you
will now be able to remove the default storage with;

    lxc storage delete default
