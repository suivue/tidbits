Directory permissions in *nix:

- r (read): 
  Can see the directory contents i.e., list the contents from outside. 
  Can enter the directory and list. 
  Without read permission, we cannot list the contents of the directory 
  but if we know the filename, we can edit (and save) it as long as we 
  have write permission.

- w (write):
  Can create a file/directory and delete a file/directory (from outside
  as well as from within the directory meaning can enter the directory).
  Without write permission, we cannot create or delete file/directory 
  inside the directory. However, we can write to a file because that is 
  governed by write permission of the file.

- x (execute):
  This is redefined for directory permissions and not carry same meaning
  as executing/running a file. It means accessing the directory. We cannot
  access or enter the directory. 
  Without execute/access permission, 
  - can list the contents if we have read permission (list followed 
    by errors). 
  - cannot create or delete any file inside 
  - cannot read (opens empty) any file or write to any file even when
    we have read/write permission to the file itself.
