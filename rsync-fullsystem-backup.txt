Rsync command to take full system backup:

    Run the following command as root to make sure that rsync can access
all system files and preserve the ownership:

# rsync -aAXHv --exclude={"/dev/*","/proc/*","/sys/*","/tmp/*","/run/*","/mnt/*","/media/*","/lost+found"} / /path/to/backup

    By using the -aAX set of options, the files are transferred in
archive mode which ensures that symbolic links, devices, permissions,
ownerships, modification times, ACLs, and extended attributes are
preserved, assuming that the target file system supports the feature. The
option -H preserves hard links, but uses more memory.

    The --exclude option causes files that match the given patterns to be
excluded. The directories /dev, /proc, /sys, /tmp, and /run are included
in the above command, but the contents of those directories are excluded.
This is because they are populated on boot, but the directories
themselves are not created. /lost+found is filesystem-specific. The
command above depends on brace expansion available in both the bash and
zsh shells. When using a different shell, --exclude patterns should be
repeated manually. Quoting the exclude patterns will avoid expansion by
the shell, which is necessary, for example, when backing up over SSH.
Ending the excluded paths with * ensures that the directories themselves
are created if they do not already exist.
