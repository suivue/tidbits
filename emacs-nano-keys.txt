Emacs (and mostly nano and bash) keybindings:
=============================================

C-v : move to next screen
M-v : move to previous screen (M usually does same as C but in opposite direction.)
C-f : move forward a character at a time
C-b : move backward a character at a time
C-n : move to next line
C-p : move to previous line
M-f : move forward a word (not in nano), goes to end of word (space or punctuation)
M-b : move backward a word (not in nano), goes to first letter of the word
C-a : move to beginning of a line
C-e : move to end of a line
M-a : move to beginning of a sentence (not in nano)
M-e : move to end of a sentence (not in nano)
M-< : move to beginning of whole text (like gg in vim) (not in nano)
M-> : move to end of whole text (like G in vim) (not in nano)
C-u : prefix for numerical argument e.g., C-u 8 C-f repeats C-f 8 times. 
	Numerical argument is also called repeat count.
	C-u N C-u/C-v move be N lines not N screenfuls.
C-g : cancel the command
C-x 1 : one window (kill all other windows)
<DEL> : delete character just before the cursor (the Backspace key)
M-<DEL> : kill the word immediately before the cursor
<Delete> : delete character under the cursor (the actual Delete key)
C-d : delete the next character after the cursor (same as <Delete> key)
M-d : delete the next word after the cursor
C-k : kill from cursor position to end of line
M-k : kill to end of the current sentence
C-<SPC> : to start visual block (Ctrl-v in vim) and then C-w cuts entire selection
C-y : yank or paste back killed text
M-y : yank previous text in buffer (and backwards if repeated)
C-/ : undo last action
C-_ : undo last action (same as C-/)
C-x u : undo last action
C-x C-f : find (open) a file
C-x C-s : save a document
C-x C-b : view buffers
C-x b : switch to a buffer (by typing its name into the minibuffer
C-x s : save some buffer
M-x <mode> : change emacs mode (default is 'Fundamental')

asdf asdf asdf asdf

NOTE: We can notice the parallel between C-f and C-b on the one hand, and 
M-f and M-b on the other hand.  Very often Meta characters are used for 
operations related to the units defined by language (words, sentences, 
paragraphs), while Control characters operate on basic units that are 
independent of what you are editing (characters, lines, etc).

NOTE: 'killing' and 'deleting' are different in that, "killed" text can be 
reinserted (at any position), whereas "deleted" things cannot be reinserted
this way. We can however, un-delete them.
